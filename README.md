Visual editor to create nassi-shneiderman diagrams.

This is an old school project of mine. It is one of my first personal java projects and I implemented it in 2010/2011.  
That's why the code is like a beginner's code and it is written in german.  
I decided to publish it, because there are some change requests, mostly from teachers, and I don't find time to implement them.

## Contribution  
Feel free to contribute to this project via PullRequests.  
Please write new code and git commit messages in english. Texts, that are shown in the UI, should still be german.  
Automatic tests would be awesome.
